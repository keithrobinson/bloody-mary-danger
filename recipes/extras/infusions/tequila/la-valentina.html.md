This one comes from the guys who make the awesome [Porthole Infuser](http://www.theportholeinfuser.com/). As such the directions here are specifically for the porthole, but I imagine you could do the same with anything you usually use for infusions.


Ingredients
-----------

* 3 large strawberries
* 1/2 medium sized Navel or Valencia orange
* 2 oz roasted cacao nibs
* 7 oz Tequila Blanco
* 2 3/4 oz Grand Marnier
* 1 dried chipotle pepper


Technique
-----------

* Wash fruit.
* Quarter strawberries lenghtwise, stem on, and fan-slice them.
* Cut orange cross-grain into 1/8 inch thick slices. Half the slices.
* Arrange 6 strawberry fans in Porthole, alternating skin and pulp facing the glass pane.
* Sprinkle half of cacao nibs on strawberries.
* Arrange a layer of orange slices.
* Sprinkle rest of cacao nibs on oranges.
* Add the dried chipotle pepper. Try and place it where it won't be easily seen. (They're not pretty.)
* Arrange remaining strawberries, lightly packing the Porthole cavity.
* Close Porthole, tighten screw, squeeze, snug screws, and check for good seal.
* Combine tequila and Grand Marnier.
* Fill Porthole with combined liquids.
* Infuse for a minimum of 30 minutes before sampling, consume within 4 hours (extended infusion of orange rind will turn the infusion bitter).


Notes
-----------

* Herencia Mexicana is recommended, but I had trouble finding that and went with El Espol&#xF3;n Blanco.
