A bit more fruity tham the [Sangrita Tradicional](/extras/garnishes/sangrita-tradicional.html), this tropical delight is the perfect back to a nice tequila blanco.

Ingredients
-----------
* 3 cup pineapple juice
* 1/2 cup orange juice
* 2 limes
* 6 tbsp hot sauce

Preparation
-----------

* Juice the lime.
* Blend or mix until well combined.

Notes
-----------

* Experiment with the hot sauce, a nice fruit based sauce, like a mango haba√±ero, works really nicely.
