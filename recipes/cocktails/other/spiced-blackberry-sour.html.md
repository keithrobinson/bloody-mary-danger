The original was found in [My Year in Cocktails](http://www.amazon.com/My-Year-Meals-Cocktails/dp/1451659725) by John Cusimano. It's not like any sour we know of. For one thing, there's no whiskey in it. But, whatever, this is a good 'un. It's lightly spicy, slightly sweet, easy enough to make and full of frothy goodness.

Ingredients
-----------

* 4 blackberries
* 1 oz vodka
* 1 oz spiced rum
* 1 oz lime juice
* 1 egg white
* Zest of 1 lemon
* 1/2 oz simple syrup
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters

Technique
-----------

1. Muddle the blackberries in a shaker
2. Pour in the rest of the ingredients
2. Add ice and shake vigorously
3. Serve in a martini glass
