Originally based off the Leap Year cocktail; replacing the bitterness with sweetness, The Austin is the best type of gin drink; slightly sweet and slightly crisp with a nice, warm tingle on the end.

Ingredients
-----------

* 1/2 Fresno chili
* 1 1/2 oz gin
* 1/2 oz Grand Marnier
* 3/4 oz lime juice
* 1/4 oz simple syrup
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters

Technique
-----------

1. Slice the chili and remove the seeds
2. Muddle the chili and pour in the rest of the ingredients
2. Add ice and shake vigorously
3. Pour into a martini glass

Notes
-----
* You can make it without the chili and it's still really nice.
* Will need to try this one with a hotter chili.
